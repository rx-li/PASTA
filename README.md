# PASTA
PASTA (PAthway-oriented Spatial gene impuTAtaion) is a tool to imputate pathway expression for a spatial transcriptomic dataset referring to a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. 
The spatial transcriptomics dataset and the corresponding reference scRNA-seq data should be from the same tissue for imputation accuracy.
