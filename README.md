# PASTA

PASTA (PAthway-oriented Spatial gene impuTAtaion) is a tool to imputate pathway expression for a spatial transcriptomic dataset referring to a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset. 
The spatial transcriptomics dataset and the corresponding reference scRNA-seq data should be from the same tissue for imputation accuracy. 

# How to install
* Set up environment 
$ conda env create -f environment.yml $
* Install PASTA by typing the following in shell
$$
